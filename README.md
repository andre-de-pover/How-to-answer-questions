# ‚ùî How-to-answer-questions

This is not to be overlooked and is key to answering questions concisely so the interviewer can ask more questions and leave time at the end so you can ask questions too!

‚≠ê STARR technique (which stands for Situation, Task, Action, Result and Reflection)

This is a technique that helps you to structure your response and the details to focus on, interviewers are interested in detail and the journey/story not a list of tools and technologies or something multiples times a different company e.g., Oh yeah, I have done that at X, Y, Z company I am very experienced.

# üîâ STARR answer Example:
The platform we were delivering was implementing contactless payments and there were several stories we had to breakdown and implement across the 3 teams in product, the one I was in was called 'autotune' which was compromised of 5 engineers and 1 team lead. I was focused on creating the application design and delivering end to end and using *enter tools & languages*. It was a fun project and we were able to deliver it over 6 months, however there were a few challenges *enter challenges*. If I was to do it again, I may look to do *enter learnings* differently.

### üôâ Things to be conscious of
- Think you are talking too much? You probably are, so take a pause and ask the interviewer if you should carry on with your explanation. This allows them to move on if t5hey already have what they need
- Silences - Don't feel that you need to fill them, it's ok to think about your answers before jumping into an explanation
- Didn't hear the question? Ask for the question again or if you don't understand the question ask for them to clarify it further
- Read the room - If the audience doesn't look engaged, pause and make sure you are answering their question
- Honesty - If you don't know something be honest rather than waste precious time. they will appreciate this so they can focus on the things you are good at rather than the things you aren't
- Talking over the interviewer - You may be eager to answer the question, however let them finish, it can become frustrating for the interview(s)
- Negativity - don't focus on the bad, you can cover this, however spend more time on the positive along with what you have achieved
